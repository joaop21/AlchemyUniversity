# Block Explorer

This is a block explorer page that has 3 columns:

1. The block list column that shows the last 10 blocks;
2. The block colum that shows the info of a block when clicked in the block list column;
3. The transaction column that shows the transaction info when clicked in the block column;

To run this project, you just need to run `yarn dev`, and that's it.
